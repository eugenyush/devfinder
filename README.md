# DevFinder - A GitHub Profile Search App

**DevFinder** is a React-based web application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles. It provides details such as repositories, followers, and other profile information, making it easier to discover and explore GitHub developers.

It is built using:

- **React**
- **GitHub API** (to fetch user data)
- **JavaScript**
- **CSS** (for styling)

## ðŸ‘¾ Features

- Search for GitHub users by username.
- Display detailed user profiles with followers, repository count, and bio.
- Fully responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile.
- Error handling for invalid usernames or API issues.
- Light and dark mode toggle for better user experience.

## ðŸ“’ Process

I started by setting up the basic structure of the application with React. Next, I connected the app to the GitHub API, enabling the user to search for profiles by username. 

Once the API integration was completed, I focused on designing a clean and responsive interface using CSS. The app includes error handling for cases where a user is not found, and additional features like dark mode for improved user experience.

**NOTE:** The application uses the public GitHub API to fetch user data in real-time.
